<p> Deaf education aims to address the educational, linguistic, cultural, and social needs of students who are deaf or hard-of-hearing by providing a continuum of services based on their individual needs. In the United States, deaf education dates back to the 1800s when both oral and manual methods of instruction were imported from Europe. There are three main communication methods used in the education of deaf and hard-of-hearing students: (1) the oral approach, also known as the listening and spoken language method, emphasizes the use of hearing amplification technology (hearing aids and cochlear implants) in order to develop spoken language skills; (2) the Total Communication approach advocates for the use of multiple means of communication, including signing that follows English word order, speaking, lip reading, listening via amplification technology, and finger spelling, to address the students‚Äô needs; (3) the bilingual-bicultural approach, also known as the American Sign Language (ASL)/English bilingual approach, and sign bilingualism outside of the United States, adheres to the principles of additive bilingualism and aims to develop proficiency in a signed and a spoken language. Controversy over which approach is most appropriate to educate deaf and hard and hearing children persists to this day. Schools where students who are deaf or hard-of-hearing are educated vary depending on the level of integration they have with hearing students. They may be educated in full inclusion, mainstream programs, or special schools (day and residential schools for the deaf), each providing different levels of support and access. The passing of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which required states to provide ‚Äúfree appropriate public education‚Äù in the least restrictive environment (LRE) as determined by the child‚Äôs individualized education plan (IEP), had an impact on the number of deaf and hard-of-hearing children who were then placed in regular classrooms (full inclusion and mainstream settings). The educational and deaf communities argued that this placement did not lead to appropriate education, and that it was the opposite of LRE because it did not consider the language and communication needs of children who were deaf or hard-of-hearing. Access to language and communication as well as literacy development is at the core of the research in the field of deaf education, with an overall emphasis on the benefits that early identification and intervention have on their early language, academic, and social-emotional development.
<h2>Lets divide Deaf education into 2 parts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Auditory-oral education </li>
    <p><ol>
        <li>What is Auditory/Oral Education?</ol></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The Auditory/Oral (A/O) approach teaches infants and young children to use hearing and speech to develop spoken language for communication and learning. Children typically attend a pre-school or early elementary program taught by teachers and therapists with A/O and child development training and experience. Signs are not used in the A/O approach; however, natural gestures that are used in typical conversation are included.
            </ul></li>
            </p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>What issues are at the forefront of Auditory/Oral Education?</ul></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The goal with A/O is for children to enter the mainstream after they have time to strengthen their language, social and cognitive development in an A/O program. Given the importance of working with A/O qualified educators and therapists, families are encouraged to inquire about professional training and experience.
                    </ul></li>
                    </p>
    <li>auditory-verbal education</li>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Auditory Verbal therapy is a highly specialist, early intervention, family-centred, coaching programme which equips parents and caregivers with the tools needed to support the development of their deaf child‚Äôs listening and spoken language. 
                Auditory Verbal therapy supports deaf children to learn how to make sense of the sound they receive through their hearing technology (such as hearing aids or cochlear implants) so they can learn to talk like their hearing friends.
